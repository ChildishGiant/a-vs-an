The "glottis" is defined as the combination of the vocal folds and the space in between the folds (the rima glottidis).

Function
As the vocal folds vibrate, the resulting vibration produces a "buzzing" quality to the speech, called "voice" or "voicing" or "pronunciation". 

Sound production involving only the glottis is called "glottal". English has a voiceless glottal fricative spelled "h". In many accents of English the glottal stop (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant allophone of the phoneme  __  (and in some dialects, occasionally of  __  and  __ ); in some languages, this sound is a phoneme of its own.

Skilled players of the Australian didgeridoo restrict their glottal opening in order to produce the full range of timbres available on the instrument. 


The vibration produced is an essential component of "voiced" consonants as well as vowels. If the vocal folds are drawn apart, air flows between them causing no vibration, as in the production of voiceless consonants. 

The glottis is also important in the valsalva maneuver.

Voiced consonants include  __ 
Voiceless consonants include  __
