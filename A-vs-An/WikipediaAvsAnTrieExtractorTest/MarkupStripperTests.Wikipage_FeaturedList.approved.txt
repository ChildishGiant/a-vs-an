A featured list exemplifies our very best work. It covers a topic that lends itself to list format (see WP:List) and, in addition to meeting the requirements for all Wikipedia content (particularly naming conventions, neutrality, no original research, verifiability, citations, reliable sources, living persons, non-free content and what Wikipedia is not) a featured list has the following attributes:

 "Prose." It features professional standards of writing.
 "Lead." It has an engaging lead that introduces the subject and defines the scope and inclusion criteria.
 "Comprehensiveness."
  (a) It comprehensively covers the defined scope, providing at least all of the major items and, where practical, a complete set of items; where appropriate, it has annotations that provide useful and appropriate information about the items.
  (b) In length and/or topic, it meets all of the requirements for stand-alone lists; does not violate the content-forking guideline, does not largely duplicate material from another article, and could not reasonably be included as part of a related article.
 
 "Structure." It is easy to navigate and includes, where helpful, section headings and table sort facilities.
 "Style." It complies with the Manual of Style and its supplementary pages.
  (a) "Visual appeal." It makes suitable use of text layout, formatting, tables, and colour; and a minimal proportion of items are redlinked. 
  (b) "Media files." It has images and other media, if appropriate to the topic, that follow Wikipedia's usage policies, with succinct captions. Non-free images and other media satisfy the criteria for the inclusion of non-free content and are labeled accordingly.
 
 "Stability." It is not the subject of ongoing edit wars and its content does not change significantly from day to day, except in response to the featured list process.
